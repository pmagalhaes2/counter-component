# Counter Component

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to practicing React.js

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

- Create a React project using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) template;
- React.js Functional Components;
- Create components with props;
- React useState Hook.

# Behavior
